  <div class="intro">
    <p>PM Modi in his address to the nation today highlighted the importance of encouraging a strong and self-reliant economy 
      in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic. In the 40 minute address with ‘Atma Nirbharta’ or self-reliance as its leit motif, 
      the PM repeatedly focussed on the importance of a local economy. “Be vocal about local” is one of the catchphrases he used 
      to highlight the importance of not only using but also endorsing and promoting the locally-made and locally-sourced products. 
      He cited the example of him urging the country to use Khaadi a few years ago which led to a revolution in the Indian handloom 
      sector and Khaadi did not only broke all-time sales records in India, but also became a highly exported commodity. This is an 
      article on the Top Indian Brands That Are Exported The world over, a sentiment that’s gaining traction with the increased focus 
      on PM’s Swadeshi Movement 2.0.</p>
      
     <p>In that spirit, here’s the top crowdsourced Made-in-India products and brands to choose over their foreign made counterparts. 
      Of course, there’s many small players, and no-name brands and small cooperatives that are proudly made -in-India and should be 
      considered for purchase as much as possible. This list is to highlight some of the larger made-in-India brands.</p>

      <h2>Watches</h2>
      <p>There are numerous brands worldwide making beautiful watches. These include <strong>Dior, MontBlanc, Rado, Rolex</strong>. 
        Instead of going for multinational companies opt for brands like <strong>Titan, Fast track </strong>so that we boost our
        economy and help these companies to increase further.</p>

        So instead of buying from multinational companies like <strong>Flair, Uniball, Pilot</strong> go for Indian companies like <strong>Camlin, Natraj</strong>. Even a small 
        initiative by you can help India at large.

      <p>Popular washing detergents like Surf Excel, Tide and Ariel are produced in Indian factories 
        employing Indian workforce and as such should be considered as Indian brands. But if one is 
        looking for a detergent brand that’s completely conceived and made by an Indian company, 
        then the Gujarat based Nirma, and Ghadi detergent (made by Shri Mahadeo Soap Industries Pvt. Ltd.)
        should be adopted.</p>

      <p>The one thing that everyone uses and needs, but  would be hard-pressed to find which phone 
        is made in India or made by a 100% Indian company. Let’s just  say telecom hardware is not 
        our strongest suite.But the good news is that even Chinese and Korean phone biggies such as 
        Vivo, OnePlus, Xiaomi and Samsung respectively have almost 100% production centres in India.
        That is, the phones use the tech developed and some inner components made in China and other 
        countries, but are produced and marketed in India and by Indian workforce.</p>

      <h2>Beer</h2>
      <p>The home-brewed beer brand emerged at the top of all Make-in-India lists with over 20 mentions. 
        It of course helps that in the current times Bira is also the favoured beer over its mis-named 
        counterpart, the Corona beer. Other Indian produced alcohol brands include Old Monk, Amrut, Kingfisher, 
        and Royal Challenge. The humble “IMFL” tag at bars in the country may carry more nationalistic 
        sentiment than ever and boost its sale amongst the Johnny Walker audience, once the lockdown lifts that is.</p>

        ike Starbucks, Costa Coffee, McDonalds came on to the scene. However, the country’s seen 
        a surge in a plethora of local coffee roasters and brands like Third Wave Coffee roaster, 
        Blue Tokai, KC Roasters are re-claiming and tapping the urban coffee market in India.</p>

        Mahindra, TVS and more. While some of their components and R&D may be foreign-sourced, 
        their production remains largely within India, and profits from the automobile industry 
        form a large part of India’s GDP.  </p>

        brands such as Jockey, Enamour, and more in tier 1 cities. The made-in-India
