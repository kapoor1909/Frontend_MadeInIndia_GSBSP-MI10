# Frontend_MadeInIndia_GSBSP-MI10
GirlScript Bilaspur- FrontEnd Hackathon
I made this frontend portion of the website. My theme was Made in India. We were given 48 hours to complete this.
Canva helped me alot. I made the logo using it. Almost all photos are from its gallery. I used canva elements to make the product collage. 
I used Google for collecting all the required information.
The site is made up of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 

Not perfect but I learnt alot of new things.
